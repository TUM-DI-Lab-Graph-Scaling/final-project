Suppose one has information about the chemical and spatial structure of a molecule 
and would like to predict properties of this very molecule, e.g. its energy (at the 
current point in time or after some evolution) or the forces acting on the 
individual atoms. Some of these properties might be directly
computable using quantum mechanical methods---like Density Functional Theory (DFT) 
\cite{doi:10.1021/ed5004788}. However, quantum mechanics based methods often come
with significant drawbacks as they are extremely expensive from a computational 
standpoint, imposing the necessity to either optimize these conventional methods 
as far as possible or use completely different approaches.

One alternative approach is to compute or 
predict such molecule properties using supervised
machine learning in order to learn a function that maps molecule structures to their
respective properties. For this task, Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) are very well suited not only because a molecule can naturally
be expressed as a graph (e.g. using its structural formula and
interatomic distances), but also because in this case, the 
assumption of invariance w.r.t. permutations of the atoms or the assumption that 
the update rules do not differ between nodes or edges and that one is hence
learning somewhat universal functions, seem very reasonable.

From now on, we define a molecule consisting of $n$ atoms by its atomic numbers 
$\zz$ and its positions $\XX$, where
\begin{equation}
    \XX \: \coloneqq \: \set{\xx_1, \dots, \xx_n}, \; \xx_i \in \R^3
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad 
    \zz \: \coloneqq \: \set{z_1, \dots, z_n}, \; z_i \in \N \text{.}
    \label{eq:molecule_setup}
\end{equation}
Suppose $E(\XX, \zz)$ is the energy of the whole molecule structure, then one can immediately
obtain the forces acting on the individual atoms indexed by $i \in \set{1, \dots, n}$ as
\[
    \FF_i \: \coloneqq \: \frac{\partial E(\XX, \zz)}{\partial \xx_i} \: \in \: \R^3 \text{.}
\]
If we now want to simultaneously predict the energy $E$ and forces $\FF_i$
of a molecule structure, there are two options: In \textit{energy-centric models}, 
a global graph feature which models molecule energy
is regarded as the GNN output and the forces are obtained by differentiating w.r.t.
the atom locations. In contrast, \textit{force-centric models} predict both energy and forces
directly as a global attribute and node embeddings respectively.

In many cases there is still some arbitrariness in the choice of the 
exact positions $\XX$: Energies of molecule structures might be invariant w.r.t. 
translations and rotations, or forces might be invariant w.r.t. 
translations and equivariant w.r.t. rotations. Rather than letting the model figure out
these fundamental invariants of its predicting functions on its own (e.g. by 
data augmentation), they are often directly incorporated into the model to reduce 
complexity. One approach to achieve this is to compute pairwise distances $d_{ij}$ 
between the atoms and use them instead of the individual atomic locations $\XX$. 
However, this might
not always be sufficient to completely characterize the spatial structure of a molecule:
Since the interatomic distances are only kept for a part of the pairs of 
nodes, there exist pairs of different molecules which cannot be
distinguished with this approach \cite[Appendix A]{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2003-03123}.
In the following subchapters, we will introduce two GNN architectures that were initially
proposed by Gasteiger et al. and overcome this problem.
