\subsection{Datasets}

The OC20 dataset contains training and evluation data using DFT approximation and 
structure relaxation. 

\subsubsection{Initial Structure to Relaxed Energy (IS2RE)}

Initial Structure to Relaxed Energy (IS2RE) takes an initial structure as input and 
predicts the relaxed energy \cite*{Chanussot_2021, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2206.08917}.

OC20 provides three dataset scaling factors for the IS2RE task: 10k, 100k and 
all structures + relaxations.

\subsubsection{Structure to Energy and Forces (S2EF)}

Structure to Energy and Forces (S2EF) takes a structure and predicts energy and 
per-atom forces \cite*{Chanussot_2021, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2206.08917}. 

OC20 provides three dataset scaling factors for the S2EF task: 200k, 2M 20M,  
all structures + relaxations.
