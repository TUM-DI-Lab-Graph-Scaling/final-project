\subsubsection{GemNet}

\begin{itemize}
    \item s2ef (batch size 2), is2re(batch size 2)
    \item configurations (8 times): baseline stage 0 (all deepspeed features deactivated), 
    stage 0 fp16: memory savings from deepspeed, not only from fp16. 
    \item big drop from stage 0 to stage 1: Optimizer states have huge influence on
    memory consumption, memory-wise, stage 2 with optimizer offloading best
    \item optimizer offloading saves memory, but increases runtime
    \item stage 3 seems ineffective
    \item communication overlapping (pipeline parallelism) seems ineffective.
\end{itemize}

For each experiment, we performed one epoch of training
