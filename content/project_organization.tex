\section*{Project Organization}

All work in this project was realized within the TUM Data Innovation Lab in collaboration with the Chair of 
Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. Special thanks go to our Scientific Lead PhD candidate Ludger Paehler, 
as well as our Project Lead and Co-Mentor Dr. Ricardo Acevedo Cabra.

Our project was structured in 4 phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Literature review (4 weeks)}: We read through important papers in the topics of our project such 
    as Graph Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Graph Sampling, Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry, 
    and Scalable Machine Learning, and discussed them weekly.
    \item \textit{Baseline formulation (3 weeks)}: 
    \item \textit{Implementation (4 weeks)}: After defining the baseline, we integrated and tested all deepspeed 
    stages in the OCP project during our implementation phase.
    \item \textit{Evaluation & Final report (3 weeks)}: In the final weeks of the project, we conducted baselines 
    and deepspeed experiments and recorded our observations and analysis. In addition, we focused on the final 
    report during this phase.
\end{enumerate}

Our team met twice each week on Monday and Friday to discuss progress and define next steps. Most of 
the time, individual team members met two to three additional times during the week to discuss specific 
tasks in their area of activity.
