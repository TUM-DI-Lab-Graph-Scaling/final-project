\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

Some story about how GNNs have transformed social network analysis, recommender systems, drug discovery and of course atomic simulations.

\subsection{Problem definition}

Here we describe our problem and the general goals of the project. (Can be repetitive with parts of the preleminaries)

\subsection{Contributions}

The main contributions of our project (integration of Deepspeed into OCP project to scale and speed up atomic simulations). 
Can be repetetive with later parts of our final report.
