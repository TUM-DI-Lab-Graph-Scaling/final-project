\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

Some story about how GNNs have transformed social network analysis, recommender systems, drug discovery and of course atomic simulations.

Graphs offer a powerful way to structure connected data and explore relationships between data. With data represented as graphs, various 
methods and algorithms can be used to perform analysis and gain insights. Graphs are most-commonly used in the medical domain by e.g. 
modeling population graph for disease prediction or drug discovery.

In recent years, geometric deep learning has transformed the graph domain by introducing deep neural models to graph structured data 
archieving significant performance gains in nodel-level, edge-level as well as graph prediciton tasks. 


\subsection{Problem definition}

Here we describe our problem and the general goals of the project. (Can be repetitive with parts of the preleminaries)

\subsection{Contributions}

Our main contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We scaled force and energy predictions in atomic simulations of Catalyst with Graph Neural Networks 
    by integrating Microsoft Deepspeed into the Open Catalyst Project.
    \item We evaluated the effectiveness of Deepspeed features, in particular the Zero Redundancy Optimizer, on 
    real-world graph models in contrast to only applying it to large-scale transformer models.
    \item We developed a profiling module for the OCP codebase to allow deeper investigations of CPU/GPU memory 
    usage and model runtimes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Structure}

Our final report is structured as follows: Section \ref*{section:preleminaries} follows with a overview over 
important preliminary background topics of our work. Section \ref*{section:implementation} describes important 
scaling techniques from Deepspeed and our work to integrate them into the OCP repository. In Section 
\ref*{section:evaluation}, we provide benchmark data for our changes and evaluate them in detail. Section 
\ref*{section:project_organization} gives a brief review of our project organization. Finally, Section 
\ref*{section:conclusion} wraps up the report with a conclusion.
